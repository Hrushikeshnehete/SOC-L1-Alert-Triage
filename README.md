# Overview

This repository contains a summary and key learnings from the “SOC Role in Blue Team” TryHackMe lab. The lab provides a foundational understanding of how a Security Operations Center (SOC) functions, focusing on monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats as part of a Blue Team.

# Lab Summary

In this lab, I explored the structure and day-to-day operations of a SOC. It covered how security analysts work across different tiers, how threats are detected through SIEM tools, and how incidents are handled using formal processes and documentation.
